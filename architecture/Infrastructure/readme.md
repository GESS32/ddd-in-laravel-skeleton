# Infrastructure Layer

---

## Description

The **Infrastructure Layer** provides technical and infrastructure solutions for the application.  
It is responsible for interacting with external systems, frameworks, databases, queues, APIs, file systems, and other services.  
This layer implements the specific mechanisms for data access, network requests, and everything related to interacting with the external world.

- **Repositories** — specific implementations of interfaces defined in the domain layer for interacting with databases or other data stores.
- **Service Providers** — external services such as payment systems, email services, logging, and API integrations.
- **Infrastructure Technologies** — libraries and tools that support the operation of the application, such as libraries for working with queues, caching, serialization, etc.

## Limitations

1. **Does not contain**:
    - Business logic and domain rules.
    - Logic for coordinating actions between domains.
    - Presentation or data formatting logic.

2. **Main goals**:
    - Implement technical details for interacting with external systems.
    - Provide mechanisms for data storage, API handling, and interaction with external services.

3. **Dependencies**:
    - Dependent on the **Domain Layer**, but other layers should not depend on the infrastructure. This ensures loose coupling and improves testability.
    - Should not depend on specific implementations of domain objects.
    - May depend on third-party libraries and frameworks.
